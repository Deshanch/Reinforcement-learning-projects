## Introduction

In this repository I have pushed two projects that I have done when I'm doing Reinforcement learning online course ( youtube ) by Prof. David Silver.
There two projects,
(i) Balancing cart pole
(ii) Playing atarin pong game

These are not huge projects but I did these projects, to get the idea on multi agent reinforcement learning.
